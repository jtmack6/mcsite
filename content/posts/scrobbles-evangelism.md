## The Evolution of Music Annoyance

Since people get pretty annoyed by me sending messages about the music I am listening to or what random weird genre of the day I have decided to become an evangelist for... I just took to good old Last.fm and created a scrobble list that I annoy people even more with.

## The Solution

Instead of bombarding friends with individual music messages, I've become a **scrobbles evangelist**. Now I can share my musical journey in a more organized, less intrusive way.

Check out my listening history at: [https://www.mack.sh/scrobbles](https://www.mack.sh/scrobbles)

## Why Scrobbles?

- **Passive sharing** - No need to actively message people
- **Complete picture** - Shows the full scope of my musical exploration
- **Less annoying** - People can check when they want to, not when I decide to share
- **Automatic updates** - Fresh data every 6 hours via GitHub Actions
- **Permanent record** - A living document of my musical taste evolution

## The Technical Side

This scrobbles page is powered by:
- **Last.fm API** - Fetches my recent listening history
- **GitHub Actions** - Automatically updates every 6 hours
- **Hugo** - Static site generation
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Hosting and deployment

So if you're curious about what weird music I'm into these days, just check the scrobbles page. It's probably more organized than my random messages anyway! 🎵
