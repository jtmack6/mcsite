Jim here. I have been doing this computer thing for way too long. I also attempt to play music,
which was more prevalent about 15 years ago when I used to actually play in bands. Now I spend
a lot of time tinkering with synthesizer and modular noise making machinery.

I am also a huge fan of FreeBSD, which I run almost all of personal server type stuff on, but also do a
lot of work on Linux ( usually Arch ) and CM's which I have running k8s at home.
